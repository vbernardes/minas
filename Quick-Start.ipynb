    "- `kini`: Number of clusters for each class to be found during clustering (offline phase and novelty detection process).\n",

    "- `random_state`: Seed to use for random number generation.\n",
    "- `min_short_mem_trigger`: Minimum number of samples in the short term memory required to trigger a novelty detection process.\n",
    "- `min_examples_cluster`: Minimum number of examples required to form a cluster.\n",
    "- `threshold_strategy`: Strategy used to compute the threshold for differentiating between novelty classes and concept extensions. Accepts `1`, `2`, or `3`. The strategies are defined in the [MINAS paper](http://www.liaad.up.pt/area/jgama/MINAS.pdf).\n",
    "- `threshold_factor`: Factor to use for calculating thresholds.\n",
    "- `window_size`: Window size (an integer representing the number of samples) used by the forgetting mechanism.\n",
    "- `update_summary`: Defaults to `False`. If `True`, the summary statistics for a cluster are updated when a new point is added to it.\n",
